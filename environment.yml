  - conda-forge::ffmpeg  # conda-forge ffmpeg comes with libx264 encoder, which the
                         # pytorch channel version does not include. This encoder is
                         # required for video compression defenses (ART) and video
                         # exporting. Future work could migrate this to libopenh264
                         # encoder, which is available in both channels.
