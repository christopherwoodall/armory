# Security Policy [DRAFT]

## Report a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in Armory, send a message to
[armory@twosixtech.com](mailto:armory@twosixtech.com).

In your message, please include:

1. Reproducible steps to trigger the vulnerability.
2. An explanation of what makes you think there is a vulnerability.
3. Any information you may have on active exploitations of the vulnerability (zero-day).

## Vulnerability Response

We'll review your report and conduct preliminary analysis to confirm that the vulnerability
is plausible. Otherwise, we'll decline the report.

We will not disclose any information you share with us, will use it to fix the issue and/or
coordinate a vendor response, as needed.

We'll keep you updated of the status of the issue.

Our goal is to disclose bugs as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available.
